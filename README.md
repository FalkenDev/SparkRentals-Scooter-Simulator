## About
### Background
The scooter program will be the very brain of every scooter that is driven. The program will simulate several scooters with speed, gps, sessions, battery, owner, etc. When starting up the scooter, the bike will communicate with the MongoDB database to either register a new scooter or activate an existing scooter. In order for the scooter to "know" who it is, a small configuration file will be saved per scooter. If there is nothing like that saved, it is a new scooter and it will then be registered. At certain time intervals, the scooter will update the data that the scooter itself has control over. Eg position, speed and battery. At another determined interval, the scooter will retrieve information from the database to update its own status. This is so that the scooter will know if it has been rented, shut down by admin etc.
